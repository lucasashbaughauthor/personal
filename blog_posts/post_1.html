		<div class="text-box">
			<p>My first blog post ever – and what would be a more fitting topic than <i>characters</i>. I’ve tried dossiers, POV journaling, co-opting and gender swapping existing characters, sliders of all kinds, and just about every other method a sane person can dream up. The results: <b>yuck</b>. Stale, stale, stale. And when these methods didn’t get me the vibrant characters I wanted, I did the natural thing, and I doubled down. I wrote longer dossiers. I wrote more detailed character progressions. I contorted myself into a dozen different systems until my head spun – but they still felt stiff, fake, unlived in. And to be clear, please don’t get me wrong. All of the aforementioned is great. Those exercises are important. They’re popular for a reason, but they’re not enough.<br></p>
			<p>I’ve fought this battle <i>everywhere</i>, not just in my novels. I’ve spent hours building characters in Dungeons and Dragons, in Blades in The Dark, in short stories I’ll never publish and in games I’ll never beat. I’d create characters with striking visual details, with traumatic backgrounds, with fun ticks, with alignment charts. For example, lets say a tall lawful/good man with a traumatic child hood encounter with a dog and a penchant for always chewing on sunflower seeds. Well – all of that’s great… right up until the moment he’s in an open field with no roof to have to duck under, with no dogs in sight to fear, and no seeds to chew on. What then?... Well, I believe I’ve found one good answer to this question:<br></p>
			<p><b>We care about <i>how</i> characters are, not <i>what</i> they are.</b><br></p>
			<p>What do I mean by this? I’ve made a system to break it down, and in my infinite wisdom, I have called it: Yet Another Character System – YACS.<br></p>

			<h1>Yet Another Character System (YACS)</h1>
			<p>Before I even begin, let me just say – do everything else first. Write your dossiers, create your sliders (competency/likability/etc); do it all. But then, once you have a strong understanding of <i>what</i> your character is, of <i>who</i> they are, then it is time to decide <i>how</i> they are.<br></p>
			<p>A final disclaimer: obviously I’m somewhat deep in hyperbole when I say ‘who/what’ a character is doesn’t matter at all. For many people that matters quite a lot. Hell, in a coming of age story that is the driving thrust! But regardless, if you can only answer the who/what, and not the how, your work is <b>not</b> done yet!<br></p>
			<p>Your next step is here, with YACS. The system:<br></p>
			<p>&emsp;Motivation:<br>
			&emsp;Second Motivation:<br>
			&emsp;Beliefs: [liberal/conservative]<br>
			&emsp;Conversation Role:<br>
			&emsp;Contradiction:<br>
			&emsp;Reminds Me Of: [If applicable]<br>
			&emsp;Motivation Cross-Roads:<br></p>

			<h3>Motivation and Second Motivation</h3>
			<p>If you’re of the very small subsect of people that not only cares about reading, but then also thought it worth giving my opinions a glancing over (a dangerous decission indeed!), then you're almost certainly deep enough into the craft of writing to know that characters are defined by their goals and motivations. They're do'ers, etc. But what you might not have considered is that real people have multiple goals. Not only do they have multiple goals, <i>they have multiple non-alinged goals</i>. People want different things, simultaneously, and cannot pursue them all at once.<br></p>
			
			<p>For example, at the time of writing this, I have at least two goals:<br><br>
			1.) Get bloody damned rich<br>
			2.) Be an author<br><br>
			And as anyone who's ever writen can tell you – never have two goals been farther apart.<br><br>
			It is in this conflict of motivations, that we are at our most human. When I drag myself into my boring day job on a Monday morning, contributing yet another infinitesimally small amount to my retirement fund, perpetuating my misery, and committing myself to making precisely zero progress on my goals as an author for the next 8-9 hours to come. Or vice versa, when I call out hooky from work just so I can grind out a new chapter idea that popped into my head that morning. That is the human experience, that feels real. That is a conflict of non-aligned goals.<br><br>
			Characters NEED this. I repeat: NEED. Is their conflict between patriotism and family? A dedicated patriot who also cares for a family member that's less committed or downright subversive. Is it between romance and a career? A lover who’s oh so close to obtaining their dream job but has never been lonelier. Is it between revenge and happiness? A dad with a family to die for that just can’t quite shake that urge to sneak out at night and snap necks on his crusade.<br><br>
			These motivations should be non-aligned, but not necessarily opposite either. Opposite can be okay on occasion, but too much of that feels pre-packaged, too dramatic.<br><br>
			In the above examples, the non-aligned goals also prove to be aligned <i>at times.</i> They are shaky things, wobbly. They bend into alignment, then bend apart, then back. What if the patriot’s family member is abducted by an enemy force? Saving the family member now satisfies both the patriotism and family goals. What if the lover realizes their love interest is a wonderfully talented artist without a platform. Featuring them at a corporate gala or an art night suddenly satisfies their professional and romantic motivations. What if the dad’s family goes broke and the person he’s set to get his revenge on is filthy rich. All of the sudden those revenge and happiness goals can align quiet easily. You get the idea.<br><br><p>

			<h3>Beliefs</h3>
			<p>Whether your writing is set in our real world and time, or a fantasy world where everyone has a third eyeball, all worlds have their beliefs – all worlds have their Overton Windows. How left or right of center s your charachter of their context and society? This can create some really interesting dialogue (in particular on world building aspects) that, as an author, you’d have little reason to discuss otherwise. Does one character revile dragon riders wearing red as it’s the royal color, while another thinks it’s a show of strength of the might of their nation’s economy since it sends a clear message that it is now quite affordable? There’s cool debates to be had there.<br><br></p>

			<h3>Conversation Role</h3>
			<p>This one is HUGE. Loud and boisterous? Quite and witty? Long winded and self important? Distrusting and accusatory? When more than two characters are in a conversation, how do I tell them apart without dialogue tags? Admitedly, that's a question that I'm convinced has existed since before the written word was invented, and I know I have no hope of layin git to rest for good here - but this 'conversation role' point is a good start! A longwinded self-important priest in a conversation with a distrusting pick pocket off the streets should be immediately recognizable if you know how those characters approach conversations. <i>How does your character interact with conversations?</i><br><br></p>

			<h3>Contradictions</h3>
			<p>To be human is to live in contradiction. Often times this can be related to our non-aligned goals, other times this is more simple. The classic example is a pulmonologist that smokes behind the dumpster in between patients. We are flawed people living in a flawed world, and lets face it, <i>that’s fucking messy.</i> A nutritionist drunk at McDonald’s at 3am on a Saturday, a school history teacher that rejects previous atrocities, a well meaning politician who looks the other way when his prodigal son is involved. We live in this every day. Contradictions, contradictions, contradictions!<br><br></p>
			
			<h3>Reminds Me Of</h3>
			<p>This is the most ‘cheaty’ section I can think of, and it’s quite simple. If your character is motivated by an existing one, just keep that in mind. Of course I don’t recommend plagiarism, but we all get our inspiration from somewhere! If your character shares a lot in common with Character Y, it can be easy to imagine how they would navigate a situation by imagining how Character Y would do so. Note that this section is optional.<br><br></p>

			<h3>Motivational Cross-Roads</h3>
			<p>And for the finale, the cross-roads! <i>This is where your story happens.</i> Boom, done, drop mic.<br><br>This is where your character comes to life, where you breath a soul into them. You don't need to have one drop of your story planned out, you can pants or plan the entire thing to your heart's delight, <i>but you need this.</i> You should have this question answered, and in at least some amount of detail, before your pencil even hits the page.<br><br>
			For example, you might not know anything about the world your character lives in, their life, their familly. But you should already know that their primary goal is to liberate themselves and their peers from the lower castes of society, and that (at least one of) their secondary goals is to protect and keep safe their loved ones. From this you should know that your story, wherever it may go, will unfold following the cross-road of this character's struggle to balance these two not-so-nice-playing goals. Your story's most visceral moments will be when these two goals either come into direct conflict, or direct alignment.<br><br>
			Here’s some boring singular goal examples. A dude who fights through thick and thin until he’s obtained the magical sword. A king who wants to expand his kingdom. A mother that wants the best for her son. Blah, blah, blah. These are all good, but not on their own! Let’s try again.<br><br><nr></p>
			<p>A dude who fights through thick and thin until he’s obtained the magical sword, but also strongly believes in a pacifists religion. So he’s either finding very creative solutions, or juggling more guilt than a sane man should. A mother who wants the best for her son and also wants a successful career on the city council. Well, what happens when her son turns out to be a serial killer ruining the town’s reputation, and she must now help him cover it up or report him? A king who’s wants to expand his kingdom while shrinking the political rights and wealth of adversarial nobles beneath him. It’s damned hard to get someone to give you a significant investment while also getting them to agree to be screwed over. Now those sound more interesting!<br><br></p>
			<p>Not only do those sound more interesting, <i>these cross-roads are where the story happens</i>. Your book’s/campaign’s/game’s most interesting points will be when these motivations are either sharply converging or competing. At the apex of your book, maybe your king realizes how he can expand his kingdom and screw over his nobles in one bold move, and now we have a finale! Or perhaps to kick things off, your character has to make a pain staking choice between reporting her serial killer son to the authorities, or covering up his crime.<br><br></p>

			<h1>Conclusion</h1>
			<p>This is a ‘follow up’ system, a system to be stacked onto others. Once you've done your dossiers, and your journals, and your drawings and what not – you do this next. YACS is what takes your character from a Wikipedia article to a living, breathing, person.<br><br></p>
			<p>Enjoy!<br><br><br><br></p>
