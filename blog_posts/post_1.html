		<h1 style="font-size:8vw;">On Characters - YACS</h1>
		<div class="text-box">
			<p>Here I am with my first blog post ever – and what would be a more fitting topic than _characters_. I’ve tried dossiers, POV journaling, gender swapping existing characters, sliders of all kinds, and just about every other method a sane person can dream up. The results: *yuck*. Stale, stale, stale. I don’t care that your character has to duck in cramped spaces. I don’t care that they have an irrational fear of barking dogs. And I most of all don’t even care about their weird taste for pistachios. All of these things: their height, their childhood trauma, their favorite foods; while occasionally useful and interesting, do not get me much millage - how do I write them if they’re seated at a table in a Walmart with a ceiling a mile above them, no dogs around, and not a pistachio in sight?<br></p>
			<p>And I’ve fought this battle _everywhere_, not just in my novels. I’ve spent hours building characters in Dungeons and Dragons, in Blades in The Dark, in short stories I’ll never publish and in games I’ll never beat. But alas dear reader – it is with extreme excitement that I have stumbled across just enough knowledge to be deadly. I have created yet another character system – YACS.<br></p>
			<h1>Yet Another Character System (YACS)</h1>
			<p>First and foremost: do all of the other things. Write your dossiers, create your progression (competency/likability/etc) sliders, do all of the things. Then when that’s done. When you know what you’re character’s Wikipedia page should be – but when you know very little about what they’re like as a person, then come here.<br><br>The system:<br></p>
			<p>&emsp;Motivation:<br>
			&emsp;Second Motivation:<br>
			&emsp;Beliefs: [liberal/conservative]<br>
			&emsp;Conversation Role:<br>
			&emsp;Contradiction:<br>
			&emsp;Reminds Me Of: [If applicable]<br>
			&emsp;Motivation Crossroads:<br></p>
			<p>All of these points aren’t about _who_ your character is, they’re about _how_ they are. What are they like? Why do I hate them? What do they say, and how do they say it that makes me absolutely and utterly revile? Lets get into it.</p>

			<h3>Motivation and Second Motivation</h3>
			<p>If you’re they type to even read this (a rare breed), you’ll already know that characters are defined by their motivations. Characters are do’ers, they do things, yada yada yada. All good stuff. However, what you might not have considered, is that real people have _multiple non-aligned motivations_. *People want different things, simultaneously, and cannot pursue them all at once.* For example, at the time of writing this, I have at least two motivations:<br><br>
			1.) Get bloody damned rich enough to have ‘fuck you’ money<br>
			2.) Be a bad-ass author<br><br>
			And as anyone who write can tell you – never have two goals been in more conflict than those. (I know some character creation snobs out there will detest my conflation of goals and motivations, but for the purposes of this conversation, be at ease knowing I have formerly and confidently told you all to buzz off :+1:).<br><br>
			It is in this conflict of motivations, that I am at my most human. When I drag myself into my boring day job on Monday morning, contributing yet another infinitesimally small amount to my retirement fund, perpetuating my misery, and committing myself to making precisely zero progress on my goals as an author for the next 8-9 hours to come. Or vice versa, when I call out hooky from work just so I can grind out a new chapter idea that popped into my head that morning.<br><br>
			Characters NEED this. I repeat: NEED. Is it between patriotism and family? A dedicated patriot who’s family member is less committed or downright subversive. Is it between romance and a career? A lover who’s attained their dream job but has never been lonelier. Is it between revenge and happiness? A dad with a family to die for that just can’t quite shake that urge to sneak out at night and snap necks on his crusade.<br><br>
			These motivations should be non-aligned, but not necessarily opposite either. Opposite can be okay on occasion, but too much of that feels pre-packaged, too dramatic.<br><br>
			In the above examples I gave, the non-aligned goals also prove to be aligned _at times_. The patriot’s child is abducted by an enemy force? Saving the family member now satisfies the goals of both the patriotism and family motivations. The lover realizes their love interest is a wonderfully talented artist without a platform. Featuring them at a gala or an art night suddenly satisfied their professional and romantic motivations. The dad’s family goes broke and the person he’s set to get his revenge on is filthy rich, well all of the sudden those revenge and happiness goals can align quiet easily as well. You get the idea.<br><br><p>

			<h3>Beliefs</h3>
			<p>Whether your writing is set in our real world and time, or a fantasy world where everyone has a third eyeball, all worlds have their beliefs – all worlds have their Overton Windows. How left or right of center of the society a character lives in are they? This can create some really interest dialogue in particular on world building aspects that, as an author, you’d have little reason to discuss otherwise. Does one character revile dragon riders wearing red as it’s the royal color, while another thinks it’s a show of strength of the might of their nation’s economy? There’s cool debates to be had there.<br><br></p>

			<h3>Conversation Role</h3>
			<p>This one is HUGE. Loud and boisterous? Quite and witty? Long winded and self important? Distrusting and accusatory? When more than two characters are in a conversation, how do I tell them apart without dialogue tags? And while I’m convinced that very question has existed since before the written word had even been invented, this question is a fantastic first stab at recognizing it. A longwinded self-important priest in a conversation with a distrusting pick pocket off the streets should be immediately recognizable if you know how those characters approach conversations. _How does a given character interact with conversations?_<br><br></p>

			<h3>Contradictions</h3>
			<p>To be human is to live with contradictions. Often times this can be related to our non-aligned goals, other times they’re more simple. The classic example is a pulmonologist that smokes behind the dumpster in between patients. We are flawed people living in a flawed worlds, and lets face it, _that’s fucking messy._ A nutritionist drunk at McDonald’s at 3am on a Saturday, a school history teacher that rejects previous atrocities, a well meaning politician who looks the other way when his prodigal son is involved. We live in this every day. Contradictions, contradictions, contradictions!<br><br></p>
			
			<h3>Reminds Me Of</h3>
			<p>This is the most ‘cheaty’ section I can think of, and it’s quite simple. If your character is motivated by an existing one, just keep that in mind. Of course I don’t recommend plagiarism, but we all get our inspiration for somewhere! If you’re character shares a lot in common with Character Y, it can be useful to know how your character would navigate a situation by thinking of how Character Y would do so. Note that this section is optional.<br><br></p>

			<h3>Motivational Cross-Roads</h3>
			<p>And for the finale, the cross-roads! _This is where your story happens. Boom, done, drop mic. This is where your character comes to life, where you breath a soul into them. You might not have your whole story planned out, in fact you might have none of it, but you _need_ this.
			Here’s some boring examples that don’t use this. Feel free to skip to the next paragraph whenever your eyes start to gloss over. A dude who fights through thick and thin until he’s obtained the magical sword. A King who wants to expand his kingdom. A mother that wants the best for her son. Blah, blah, blah. These are all good, but not on their own! Let’s try again.<br><nr></p>
			<p>A dude who fights through thick and thin until he’s obtained the magical sword, but also strongly believes in a pacifists religion. Now he’s either finding creative solutions, or juggling more guilt than a sane man should. A mother who wants the best for her son and also wants a successful career on the city council. Well, what happens when her son turns out to be a serial killer ruining the town’s reputation, and she must now help him cover it up or report him? A King who’s wants to expand his Kingdom while shrinking the political rights and wealth of adversarial nobles beneath him. It’s damned hard to get someone to give you a significant investment while also agreeing to be screwed over. Now those sound more interesting!<br><br></p>
			<p>Not only do those sound more interest, _those cross-roads are where the plot happens_. Your book’s/campaign’s/game’s most interest points will be when these motivations are either sharply converging or competing. At the apex of your book, maybe your king realizes how he can expand his kingdom and screw over his nobles in one bold move, and now we have a finale! Or perhaps to kick things off your character has to make a pain staking choice between reporting her serial killer son to the authorities, or covering up his crime.<br><br></p>

			<h1>Conclusion</h1>
			<p>This is a ‘follow up’ system, a system to be stacked onto others. Once you’d done your dossiers, and your journals, and your drawings and what not – you do this next. YACS is what takes your character from a Wikipedia article to a living, breathing, person.<br><br></p>
			<p>Enjoy!<br><br></p>
