		<h1 style="font-size:8vw;">Tips And Tricks</h1>
		<div class="text-box">
			<p>Some advice just doesn’t fit neatly anywhere else. This is my living, growing list, of little tips and tricks I encounter along my writing journey.<br><br></p>

<h3>Going Somewhere is a Great Excuse to Describe a Place</h3>

<p>Harry Porter arriving at Hogwarts, Katnis Evergreen at The Hunger Games, Caitlyn Stark at King’s Landing, Darrow arriving at The Institute; having a character arrive somewhere is a fantastic excuse for you to describe it from their POV. (Likewise, this ‘second world’ concept serves other story purposes depending on your approach to story structure.)<br><br></p>

<h3>The Third Character ‘Shit Stirrer Effect’</h3>

<p>A third (generally secondary) character in a scene can force two more center stage characters to interact in ways they otherwise would not naturally, aka ‘The Shit Stirrer’. Some great examples of this involve enemies to lovers scenario, or an unlikely allies scenario. A secondary character asking a hesitant couple if they’re married, an enemy attempting to kill a party member and forcing two usually-at-odds characters to cooperate to overcome the attack, etc. In general, if you want/need to force your characters in a certain direction, be it dialogue, internalization, action, or otherwise, a third character can often be a comfortable way to deliver that nudge.<br><br></p>

<h3>Prepositions Are Great Sentence Starters</h3>

<p>Trying to find ways to not start every sentence with a characters name, or ‘the’ can be really tough at times. Often times, a great way to spice it up while still respecting you (presumed) desire to stick to active language, is to start some your sentences with prepositions. “Down by the river, Dan saw a dead body bobbin in the water.” “Without Ashely, he would be nowhere, lost.”<br><br></p>

<h3>Socially Mobile Characters Are A Great Way To Explore A World’s Politics</h3>

<p>Detectives, thieves, spies, royal envoys; characters with a built in excuse to interact with people across both classes and social circles are a great way to explore a world. An amazing video game example of this would be Disco Elysium where your a secretive asking everyone form the richest rich to the poorest poor and learning about the world as it becomes relevant to your character through these interactions.<br><br></p>

<h3>Everyone Loves a Dead Body</h3>

<p>Dead bodies are the ultimate gift packaging for delivering what a writer wants. You can fit so much shit into a dead body! Tension, throughline, story progression, causation, questions, world history and lore. For example, in Promise of Blood, the opening scene takes place without action per se, but with the discovery of a recently dead body, and I’d argue it draws you in more than action ever could. The only thing scarier than a murderer is a dead body! Dead bodies just absolutely rock at causing the reader to ask a million questions.<br><br></p>

<h3>It’s Okay to Have Characters SAY What They Want</h3>

<p>Who <i>doesn’t</i> remember watching Oberyn circling The Mountain in Game of Thrones (when the series hit TV for the first time) repeating over and over “you raped her, you murdered her, you killed her children” while wielding a weapon? Chanting his character motivation like a battle cry for all to hear as viewers sit gripped on the edge of their seats. Yeah, that works in all forms of media. Having a character flatly <i>say</i> what their goal is, or what they’re motivation is, is usually pretty awesome. Personally, I will bend over backwards to concoct a situation/scene where a character has a reason to very directly just tell the reader thus directly. Yes, obviously there are <a href="showing_versus_telling.html">show don't tell consideraitons,</a> but readers crave this so much and it is so core to any POV that you have a lot of freedom to be as direct as you’d like.<br><br></p>

<h3>Fuck Grammar (With Intentionality)</h3>

<p>Breaking rules intentionally is always okay, as long as you make it clear that you know those rules exist in the first place, aka your not just being sloppy. Start your sentences with’and’s and ‘but’s. Run on as long as you’d like, repeat yourself when you want. Here’s a great quote from The Devils that does this nicely: “[…] the Holy City led around and around in chilly circle crawling with an unimaginable density of pilgrims, prostitutes, dreamers, schemers, relic-buyers, indulgence-dealers, miracle seekers, preachers and fanatics, tricksters and swindlers, prostitutes, thieves, merchants and moneylenders, soldiers and thugs, an astonishing quantity of livestock on the hoof, cripples, prostitutes, crippled prostitutes, had he mentioned the prostitutes?”<br><br></p>

<h3>Boring Stuff Is Boring</h3>

<p>We don’t need the play by play if your Mc’s travel between two cities if it’s irrelevant. Books happen in scenes, not full on accounts, leave out the boring stuff! Scene transition markers within chapters are a thing for a reason, or he’ll, just write shelter chapters, that’s certainly in vogue with some authors.<br><br></p>

<h3>Cool Stories Are Everywhere</h3>

<p>Cool stories exist everywhere. I love anime and video games as much as I do books. TV shows and movies all the same. Hell, you should see the sheer quantity of history podcasts I listen to. Yes - absolutely you need to <i>read</i> to get better at writing, but much of story telling mediums have more in common than they do apart, and even just the inspirations and vibes you get from all of them really do add to your experience as an author. They can be a fun way to explore stories if your eyes or tired or if your lazy one day or just want to change it up.<br><br></p>
